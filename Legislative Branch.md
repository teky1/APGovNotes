# Legislative Branch
The Legislative Branch is the branch that creates and drafts legislation.

### Limiting Congress' Power
When the Constitution was originally written, people believed that the Legislative branch would become the most powerful branch. Congress has the potential to have alot of power so it is necessary that it is limited by the other branches of government.
