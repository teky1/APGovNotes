# The Revolving Door
The name given to the effect where right after representatives and senators leave Congress, they become lobbyists ([[Lobbying]]) and get paid extremely high salaries to get back into government

This overall causes the same people to be in charge in the government which is not good for democracy.

These former congressmen go back and forth between Washington and Wall St after they leave Congress. This back and forth motion is why this effect is known as "The Revolving Door." They both make money, and influence politics.
