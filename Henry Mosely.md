### Origin of Periodic Law
While working with [[Ernest Rutherford]] examing spectra of some metals, Mosely noticed that there was a previous unrecognized pattern. 

He noticed that the patterns in the periodic table worked better when they were sorted by atomic charge/atomic number rather than by [[Atomic Mass]].

Mendeleev's ordering of the periodic table was not strictly by [[Atomic Mass]] as he also considered an element's properties. Mendeleev's ordering matched the ordering that Mosely got when sorting the table by atomic number. This explained the inconsistencies in Mendeleev's ordering and this concept is correctly stated in **Periodic Law**.

**Periodic Law:** *The physical and chemical properties of the elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers.*
