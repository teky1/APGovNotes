# Atomic Mass
The quantity of matter contained in an atom of an element. 

### AMU
Atomic mass is generically expressed in AMU (Atomic Mass Units)

The concept of AMU became considered a standard at the [[First International Congress of Chemists]].

The standard mass that AMU is based on is the mass of a carbon-12 atom which has  a mass of exactly 12 amu.

$$\text{carbon-12 mass} = 12 \text{ amu} = 1.992646547*10^{-23}\text{ g}$$
$$1 \text{ amu} = \frac{\text{carbon-12 mass}}{12}$$
