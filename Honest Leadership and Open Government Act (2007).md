# Honest Leadership and Open Government Act (2007)
This act was an attempt to prevent/slow down a bunch of shady things that lobbyists ([[Lobbying]]) did.

Stated that former congress members must wait 2 years before they can register as lobbyists ([[Lobbying]]). This was an attempt to slow down [[The Revolving Door]].

This act also placed restrictions on the amount of gifts, meals, and travelling expenses lobbyists ([[Lobbying]]) could gift to Congressman and legislators. This was an effort to eliminate [[Wining and Dining]] though it's effectiveness is questionable as lobbyists could just find other off-the-books way to influence legislators.

This act also increased the penalties that were issued for violations of these laws
