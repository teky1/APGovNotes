# History of the Periodic Table

### Confusing Beginning

By the middle of the nineteenth century there were over 60 known elements. During this time chemists were trying to study and learn as much about this elements as they could. 

**Inevitable Inconsistencies**
At this time, there was no standard way to accurately determine the atomic mass of an element or the number of atoms of an element in a particular chemical compound. Different chemists went about these calculations in different ways which led to numerous inconsistencies. 

### Standardization Begins

In September of 1860, an effort began to standardize and settle certain matters and inconsistencies that were making communication difficult. A group of chemists assembled at the [[First International Congress of Chemists]] to go through some of these matters.

### Initial Creation of the Table
Based on the developments made at the [[First International Congress of Chemists]], the Russian chemist, [[Dmitri Mendeleev]], created the first iteration of a Periodic Table (details in [[Dmitri Mendeleev]]) based on patterns he had noticed. This first iteration left some people with questions. such as
1. Why were there some exceptions in the trends in the Periodic Table where certain elements did not follow certain patterns?
2. Why does chemical periodicity exist

### Development of the Table
The second question listed in the previous section was answered my [[Henry Mosely]] and is explained in the Periodic law (detailed in [[Henry Mosely]]).
