# Dmitri Mendeleev
Russian chemist who played a significant role in the creation and organization of the Periodic Table

### Chemical Periodicity
After seeing the developments made at the [[First International Congress of Chemists]], Mendeleev wanted to include these new values in a book he was writing. In his book, he organized the elements based on their properties.

To do this, Mendeleev created cards with elements and their properties on them. He then tried to arrange the cards based on these properties while looking for trends or patterns.

He noticed that when the elements were arranged **in order of increasing atomic mass**, certain similarities appeared in regular intervals. These types of repeating patterns are referred to as *periodic* because they occur in repeating periods. These develoepd to become the periods that we know of on the modern periodic table.

### Predictions
When Mendeleev created his first iteration of the periodic table, there weren't nearly the same amount of known elements as there are now. Using his table, Mendeleev made predictions about elements that would be discovered in the future and many of his predictions were pretty accurate.
